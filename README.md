# Goal Pool

My uncle and his friends have been running an NHL goal pool since 80s, and it's all been tracked by pen and paper since then. This repo is my implementation of their game using React and Rust.

The rules are simple, each person in the pool gets to pick 5 players. Whoever's team scores the most goals in that regular season wins. You can also do playoff pools with the same rules, but of course some players get elimnated through the playoffs.
